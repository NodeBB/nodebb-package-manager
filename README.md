## NodeBB Package Manager

The NodeBB Package Manager functions as a directory/index for every plugin that is published to npm.

The front-end interface is deprecated (though still runs), and the API is referenced by all NodeBBs to determine what packages are available and installable.

## Caveat Emptor

NodeBB Inc., NodeBB, and all of its contributors are not responsible for the content of any plugins published. You are advised to inspect the source code of
any plugins you wish to install, in order to determine it's safety.
